## Title: **ConTrivia**

**Description:**
  A app where a user can create their own trivia categories with questions and answers. In its current state ConTrivia's purpose is to simply store the questions and answers. This app is made with React for a much more seamless feel when clicking between links.

**App Inspiration:**
  I have found many occasions where I want to play a trivia game with others but can’t seem to find a category that suits us with appropriate difficulty. 
  
  In this app a user should be able to select an existing category or create a new category, then within that category add to the list of questions and answers that already exist if any. That’s all. They can then view the questions to be played in their own way. In this form the app performs CRUD opperations.


**Technologies Used:**
  HTML, SCSS (SASS), Javascript, Express, Mongoose, React, Heroku, Netflify.

**Getting Started:**
  1. To get started click on this link to go to the app's deployed domain.
  https://contrivia.netlify.app/
  2. The user is greeted with a splash page and can click the button to proceed.
  3. If a category exists the user can select it to view the questions pertaining to it.
  4. You can then view a list of questions, answer, and its difficulty level in that category
  5. You can future click on Edit Questions if you want to modify any of the values.
  6. Creating a new category with its question and answer can be done from the link in the nav. Otherwise click on the nav link (category) to see the full list again.
  7. That is all


  **Future Enhancement:**
  1. Future goals will be to create some form of questionnaire so that the user can be asked the question themselves without being shown the answer until they reveal it with a button. 
  2. Deleting a specific question as opposted to the entire category will also be a stretch goal. 
  3. User authentication.
